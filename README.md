# Real-time Object Detection

Welcome to Real-time Object Detection! This project utilizes the power of machine learning to detect objects in real-time using a pre-trained SSD MobileNet V3 model. With this project, you can easily identify various objects, such as people, vehicles, animals, and more, directly from your webcam feed.

## How It Works

1. **Model Initialization**: The project loads a pre-trained SSD MobileNet V3 model, which has been trained on the COCO dataset for object detection.

2. **Object Detection**: Using the model, the project performs real-time object detection on the frames captured from the webcam feed.

3. **Display Results**: Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and labeled with their corresponding class names in real-time, providing instant feedback.

## Getting Started

To run Real-time Object Detection on your machine, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KelvinPuyam/Real-time-object-detection
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd Real-time-object-detection
```

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the `real_time_object_detection.py` script using Python:

```bash
python real_time_object_detection.py
```

4. **Enjoy Real-time Object Detection**: Once the script is running, your webcam will activate, and you'll see objects being detected in real-time on your screen. Press 'q' to quit the application and you will find a video recording of your detection session saved in the project directory. Happy detecting! üé•üîç

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome! Here's how you can get involved:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a Branch**: Make your changes in a new branch. This keeps your main branch clean and allows for easier review of your changes.

3. **Make Changes**: Implement your suggested improvements or add new features in the codebase.

4. **Create a Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main repository. Provide a clear description of the changes you've made and why.

5. **Review and Merge**: Your PR will undergo review by the project maintainers. They may provide feedback or ask for further changes. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch.

Feel free to open an issue if you have any suggestions or questions before making changes. Thank you for your contributions! üöÄ
